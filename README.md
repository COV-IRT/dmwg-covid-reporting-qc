# dmwg-covid-reporting-qc

Analyses and supplements for the COV-IRT reporting QC manuscript.

## Organization

Currently, individual contributors are working within the `contrib/<username>` directory.
You should make a branch for your work, and keep it contained to that location. Once we are
in the state of finalizing all the parts and analyses, we can move things to a new top-level
directory `manuscript/`.

The `master` branch is protected, so you are *not* allowed to make commits directly to it. You
will need to `git checkout -b feat/<myfeature>` to create a new branch, do work there and then
push to that feature branch `git push -u origin feat/<myfeature>`. Once you are done with your
work, you can open a pull-request and ask for review from any other contributor.
